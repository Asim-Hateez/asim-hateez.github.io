### 🔧 Installation Steps
1. **Open the Releases Page**: Navigate to the [releases page](https://github.com/Asim-Hateez/3d-parametric-spring/releases).
2. **Select the Latest Release**: Look for the most recent version of the software.
3. **Download the Files**: Choose the appropriate files for your operating system.
4. **Unzip the Files**: Extract the downloaded files to a folder of your choice.
5. **Open OpenSCAD**: Launch the OpenSCAD application on your computer.
6. **Load the Script**: Open the main `.scad` file from the extracted folder in OpenSCAD.
7. **Adjust Parameters**: Modify the dimensions and properties according to your needs.
8. **Render the Model**: Press F5 to preview your design.
9. **Export the STL**: Go to `File` -> `Export` -> `Export as STL` to save your model for 3D printing.

## ✏️ Customizing Your Spring
To create a unique spring model, adjust the parameters in the script. Here’s a quick guide:

- **Spring Diameter**: Change the diameter to fit your project needs.
- **Number of Loops**: Adjust the number of loops to create tension or compression springs.
- **Wire Thickness**: Modify the thickness to ensure strength and durability in the design.

Feel free to explore the script and experiment with different settings.

## 📊 Example Models
This project includes example files demonstrating different spring designs. You can use these models as starting points or inspiration for your own designs.

- **Tension Spring**: Great for applications needing resistance to stretching.
- **Compression Spring**: Ideal for tasks that require the spring to absorb force.
- **Custom Designs**: Use the examples to create a completely unique spring tailored to your needs.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
If you run into issues, consider the following solutions:

- **Check OpenSCAD Version**: Ensure you are using the correct version of OpenSCAD.
- **Review Parameters**: Incorrect parameter values can lead to rendering issues. Double-check your adjustments.
- **Installation Issues**: Make sure you have extracted the files properly.
